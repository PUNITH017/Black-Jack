# Black-Jack
Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get cards that add up to a higher count than the dealer's card, up to but not exceeding 21.

Blackjack is usually played at a table of 2-7 players.

# Cards:
 The dealer uses one deck of 52 cards or more decks from a shoe holder. Aces count as 1 or 11, and face cards count as 10.

# Dealing: 
Players receive all cards face up, and the dealer's first card is face up and the second is face down.

# Bets:
Players place bets for each hand.

# Busting: 
If a hand goes over 21, it is called a “bust” or “break” and the wager is lost.
